# DBS-Banking-Analytics-Project
The DBS Banking Data Analytics Project focused on analyzing large-scale banking data to gain insights into customer transactions, loan performance, and branch-level trends. The project aimed to enhance financial decision-making and operational efficiency through interactive data visualization and advanced analytics.

Using SQL, raw banking datasets were cleaned, normalized, and transformed into a structured relational database, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Key tables were linked through optimized data models to support efficient querying and deeper financial analysis.

Dashboards were designed and developed in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to monitor critical metrics such as loan disbursement trends, customer segmentation, transaction volumes, and branch performance. These dashboards provided dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities for detailed, real-time insights.

A comprehensive data validation and quality assurance process was implemented to verify data accuracy across all visual reports. The analysis revealed key patterns in customer behavior, high-performing branches, and factors influencing financial outcomes.

Overall, the project demonstrated strong skills in data modeling, SQL querying, and business intelligence reporting, successfully translating complex banking data into actionable insights that support data-driven strategies and improved business performance.
